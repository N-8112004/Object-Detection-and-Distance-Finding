# Object-Detection-and-Distance-Finding
This project implements a real-time object detection and distance measurement system using an Arduino Nano and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The system continuously measures the distance between the sensor and an object using the Time-of-Flight (ToF) principle and displays the measured distance on a 16x2 I2C LCD.
